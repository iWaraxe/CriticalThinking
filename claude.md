## Course Creation Workflow

### Phase 1: Repository Analysis
```bash
# Check existing lecture files
ls lectures/en/
# Identify missing lectures based on syllabus
```

### Phase 2: File Creation
Create missing lecture files following naming convention:
```
lecture-01-ai-detectives.md
lecture-02-how-ai-thinks.md
lecture-03-bias-detectives.md
lecture-04-error-alert.md
lecture-05-question-masters.md
lecture-06-ai-ethics-arena.md
lecture-07-creative-lab.md
lecture-08-showcase-launch.md
```

### Phase 3: Structure Planning
For each lecture, analyze the syllabus and create hierarchical structure:
1. Review lecture objectives and key topics
2. Identify logical sections (3-4 per lecture)
3. Break down into topics if needed
4. Plan slide sequence (15-20 slides per lecture)

Example structure:
```markdown
## Lecture 1: AI Detectives - What's Real in Our Digital World?

### 1.1. Welcome to the AI Age
##### [seq:010] Course Introduction
##### [seq:020] Meet Your AI Neighbors

### 1.2. What is Critical Thinking?
##### [seq:030] Thinking Like a Detective
##### [seq:040] Questions Are Your Superpower
```

### Phase 4: Content Development
For each slide, develop content in this order:

1. **SCRIPT** - Write engaging narrative
   - Age-appropriate language (12-15 years)
   - Pop culture references
   - Interactive tone ("Let's explore...", "Can you imagine...")

2. **VISUAL** - Design slide elements

   - What to observe
   - Follow-up experiments

### Phase 5: Quality Checks
- Verify each slide has required sections
- Check narrative flow between slides
- Ensure activities are age-appropriate
- Validate AI demonstrations work as intended

## Translation Workflow

### 1. Monitor English Updates
```bash
# Check for changes in English files
git diff lectures/en/
```

### 2. Translation Process
When English file is updated:
1. Identify changed sections using git diff
2. Load both English and target language files
3. Translate only updated content
4. Preserve structure and seq numbers
5. Keep section headers (SCRIPT, VISUAL, etc.) in English

### 3. Translation and Localization Rules
- Maintain exact slide structure
- Translate slide titles but keep [seq:XXX]
- **CRITICAL**: Apply deep cultural localization (see Localization Guidelines below)
- Ensure examples are relevant to target audience
- Preserve all formatting and links
- Replace generic examples with locally relevant ones
- Use appropriate local slang and expressions for teenagers
- Reference local institutions, celebrities, and cultural phenomena

### 4. Validation
```bash
# Compare structure between languages
diff -u <(grep -E "^#{1,6}" lectures/en/lecture-01-ai-detectives.md) \
        <(grep -E "^#{1,6}" lectures/ru/lecture-01-ai-detectives-ru.md)

## Course Update Workflow - Keeping Content Current

### Overview
This workflow ensures the course stays relevant with the latest AI developments while maintaining quality and preventing content bloat. Updates should be strategic, replacing outdated content rather than just adding new material.

### 1. Receiving Update Materials
When user provides new AI developments:
- News articles and press releases
- YouTube video transcripts
- Research papers and studies
- Product announcements
- Ethical controversies or incidents
- New AI tools or capabilities

### 2. Version Control Process
```bash
# Create feature branch for updates
git checkout -b update/ai-news-YYYY-MM-DD

# Work on updates
# Commit changes with descriptive messages
git add -A
git commit -m "Update: [Brief description of changes]"

# Push branch for review
git push -u origin update/ai-news-YYYY-MM-DD
```

### 3. Content Analysis Strategy

#### Step 1: Categorize New Information
Analyze incoming materials and categorize by:
- **Technology Updates**: New models, capabilities, tools
- **Bias/Ethics Cases**: New examples of AI bias or ethical dilemmas
- **Failures/Errors**: Recent AI mistakes or limitations
- **Success Stories**: Positive AI applications
- **Regulatory Changes**: New laws or guidelines
- **Cultural Shifts**: Changes in how society views/uses AI

#### Step 2: Map to Existing Content
Identify where updates belong:
- New AI models â†’ Lecture 2 (How AI Thinks)
