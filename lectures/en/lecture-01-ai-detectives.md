# Critical Thinking in the Age of AI

## Lecture 1: AI Detectives - What's Real in Our Digital World?

### 1.1. Welcome to the AI Age

##### [seq:010] Course Introduction

###### SCRIPT
Welcome, future AI detectives! üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Get ready for the coolest course you'll take this year. Imagine this: you're scrolling TikTok and see a video of your favorite celebrity saying something incredible. But wait... did they really say that? ü§î Or you're writing an essay and ChatGPT suggests an amazing fact. But is it true? In this course, you'll become digital detectives, learning to spot what's real vs fake, helpful vs misleading, and awesome vs "hmm, that's sus." Get ready to gain critical thinking superpowers that will make you unstoppable in the digital world!

###### VISUAL
- Background: Vibrant collage of popular apps (TikTok, Instagram, ChatGPT, Spotify)
- Center: Animated detective magnifying glass revealing "Real or Fake?" with neon effects
- Around: Student avatars as detectives with caps and magnifying glasses
- Colors: Neon purple, cyan blue, pink - friendly cyberpunk style
- Animation: App icons morphing into question marks

###### NOTES
- Fun fact: 90% of teens have seen at least one deepfake without knowing it!
- Discussion starter: "What's the craziest AI-generated thing you've seen?"
- Pop culture reference: Like Spider-Man learning his powers
- Misconception buster: "AI always lies" - Nope! It's a tool, like a hammer

###### ACTIVITY
**Live Autocomplete Experiment:**
1. Open phone notes app
2. Type: "My biggest fear is..." and let autocomplete suggest
3. Compare suggestions from different students
4. Discuss: Why did everyone get different suggestions?
5. Reveal: AI learns from YOUR writing patterns!

##### [seq:020] Meet Your AI Neighbors

###### SCRIPT
Reality check: AI is already EVERYWHERE in your life! ü§ñ It's in your phone's autocomplete (ever embarrassed you? üòÖ), in Snapchat filters that turn you into a cute puppy, in Spotify magically guessing your next favorite song, and even in video games adapting to your play style. But here's the twist: these AI neighbors aren't all the same. Some are super helpful, like Waze saving you from traffic. Others are kinda... weird, like when YouTube leads you down a rabbit hole of cat videos at 3 AM. Let's meet these digital neighbors and learn which ones to invite to the party and which ones to keep an eye on!

###### VISUAL
- Neighborhood-style layout with "houses" representing different AIs
- ChatGPT house: Modern, with lightbulbs (ideas) coming out windows
- TikTok house: Colorful, with music notes and hearts floating

- Small characters (students) walking between houses

###### NOTES
- Activity: Have students name 10 AIs they used this week
- Real-world connection: Compare to meeting new friends - some are great, others need boundaries
- Demo: Show how autocomplete can fail hilariously
- Reflection: "Which AI do you trust most? Why?"

###### DEMONSTRATION

### 1.2. What is Critical Thinking?

##### [seq:030] Think Like a Detective

###### SCRIPT
Okay, real talk time. Critical thinking isn't about being negative or criticizing everything (don't be that friend! üôÑ). It's about being Sherlock Holmes, but for everyday life. When a friend tells you "I heard they're canceling summer break," what do you do? Panic immediately? Post on your stories? NO! A critical thinker asks detective questions: "Where did you hear that? Does it make sense? What's the source?" It's like having a built-in reality check filter in your brain. And in a world where AI can create fake news, fake images, and even fake voices, this detective superpower is your best defense. Plus, it makes you look super smart in discussions! üòé

###### VISUAL
- Split image: Before vs After
- Left: "Before" brain - accepting everything, icons flowing straight in
- Right: "Detective" brain - with magnifying glass, filtering information
- Center: Transformation process with lightning bolts
- Thought bubbles showing questions: "Source?" "Evidence?" "Logical?"
- Style: Comic book art with vibrant colors

###### NOTES
- Analogy: Like checking ingredients before eating (allergic to anything?)
- Real-life example: Viral TikTok rumors about schools
- Quick activity: Give a wild claim, have them spot problems
- Emphasis: Critical thinking = power, not pessimism

###### ACTIVITY
**Detective Challenge: True or False?**
1. Show 3 headlines (1 real, 2 AI-generated)
2. Students vote which is real
3. Reveal answers with explanations
4. Discuss what clues gave away the fakes
5. Create a "Detective Toolkit" together

##### [seq:040] Questions Are Your Superpower

###### SCRIPT
You know what separates geniuses from everyone else? It's not that they know all the answers - it's that they ask the BEST questions! üß†‚ú® Think about it: every great invention started with someone asking "What if...?" Every mystery solved started with "But why...?" In the AI age, questions are like your magical shields against misinformation. When ChatGPT tells you spiders have 10 legs (spoiler alert: they don't üï∑Ô∏è), your question "Can you show me where you found that?" is what saves you from looking silly in your bio presentation. The best questions are like keys - they unlock doors to truth. Let's practice unlocking some doors!

###### VISUAL
- Central character with superhero cape made of question marks
- Around: Different "doors" labeled (Truth, Knowledge, Creativity)
- Floating keys shaped like questions: "Why?" "How?" "What if?"
- Background: Cityscape with buildings made of books and screens

###### NOTES
- Inspiring quote: "He who asks questions cannot lose his way" - African Proverb
- Cultural connection: Like reporters in movies uncovering truth
- Mini-game: "Most creative question" competition about a simple object
- Reminder: No stupid questions, only missed opportunities

###### DEMONSTRATION

3. See which group gets more accurate information
4. Compare questioning strategies
5. Crown the day's "Question Champion"

### 1.3. Your Digital Detective Toolkit

##### [seq:050] Essential Detective Tools

###### SCRIPT
Time to gear up with the coolest detective tools! üõ†Ô∏è Just like Batman has his utility belt, you need your digital detective kit. First up: your Fact-Checker (think of it as your personal lie detector). Then there's your Source Analyzer - does this website end in .com.fake.news? Red flag! üö© Your Bias Detector helps you spot when AI is being unfair (like when it only suggests English music). And don't forget your Logic Scanner - if something sounds too crazy to be true, it probably is. These tools aren't just concepts - they're real skills we'll practice until they become automatic. By the end of this course, you'll spot nonsense faster than you can say "fake news"!

###### VISUAL

3. Write their "detective mission statement"
4. Share with a partner
5. Create class "Detective Wall"

##### [seq:060] Challenge of the Day: Spot the Deepfake!

###### SCRIPT
Okay detectives, time for your first real mission! üéØ Deepfakes are like the shapeshifters of the digital world - videos or audio that look real but are totally fake. Remember that viral video of the celebrity saying something shocking? Or that voice call that sounded exactly like your favorite singer? Could be deepfakes! But don't worry - they have telltale signs. Weird mouth movements, strange blinking, shadows that don't match, or voices that sound just a tiny bit robotic. It's like playing "spot the difference" but with real consequences. Today, I'll show you some examples and together we'll become deepfake hunters. Ready to see through digital illusions? Let's go! üîç

### 1.4. Your Mission, Should You Accept It

##### [seq:070] The Digital Detective Oath

###### SCRIPT
Detectives, it's time to make this official! üéñÔ∏è Just like superheroes have codes, we have our Digital Detective Oath. Repeat after me: "I promise to use my critical thinking powers for good, not evil. I will verify before I share. I will question before I believe. I will protect others from misinformation. And I will always, ALWAYS keep my mind open but my skepticism filter on." This isn't just a course - it's the beginning of your journey as guardians of truth in the digital world. Every time you spot fake news, help someone avoid a scam, or simply think "hmm, let me check that," you're making the world a smarter place. And that's pretty epic! üí™

Amazing work today, detectives! üåü You've taken your first big step toward becoming unstoppable critical thinkers. Before you go, you have your first real mission. This week, I want you to be AI detectives in your daily life. Find THREE examples of AI in action - could be a weird filter, a suspicious chatbot response, or a strange recommendation. Document them like true detectives: screenshots, notes, your thoughts. Then pick ONE and investigate it. Is it helpful or problematic? How does it work? What questions do you have? Next week, you'll share your findings and we'll vote on the most interesting discovery. Remember: you're not just learning about AI, you're learning to think smarter about everything! Stay curious, stay skeptical, and see you next week! üîç‚ú®
