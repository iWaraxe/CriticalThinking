## 6.2. The Privacy Puzzle

### [seq:020] Your Data, Your Life

###### SCRIPT
Every time you use AI, you're sharing information. But where does it go? Who sees it? Could your private conversation with AI end up training the next version? Imagine telling AI about your crush, then finding similar stories in its responses to others! Privacy in the AI age is like trying to whisper in a room full of microphones – tricky but not impossible!

## 6.3. The Ownership Dilemma

### [seq:030] Who Owns AI Creations?

###### SCRIPT
You use AI to write an amazing story or create beautiful art. But who owns it – you, the AI company, or nobody? What if you win a contest with AI help – is that cheating? These questions don't have easy answers! It's like asking who owns a sandcastle when you used someone else's bucket and shovel. The rules are still being written!

## 6.4. The Fairness Fight

### [seq:040] Equal Access for All?

###### SCRIPT
Here's a tough one: AI tools cost money to run. Premium versions work better than free ones. Students with paid ChatGPT get better help than those without. Is this fair? It's like some students having calculators while others use pencil and paper. How do we ensure AI doesn't increase inequality? Should AI access be a human right?

## 6.5. The Accountability Challenge

### [seq:050] When AI Messes Up, Who's to Blame?

###### SCRIPT
AI gives bad medical advice and someone gets hurt. AI writes something offensive. AI makes a decision that ruins someone's life. Who's responsible – the user, the AI company, or the programmers? It's like a self-driving car crash – who gets the ticket? As AI makes more decisions, this question becomes super important!

## 6.6. The Future of Work

### [seq:060] Will AI Take All the Jobs?

###### SCRIPT
"AI will steal our jobs!" You've heard it, but is it true? Yes, AI can write, create art, and even code. But it can't truly understand, feel, or connect like humans. The future isn't humans OR AI – it's humans WITH AI. Jobs will change, not disappear. The key? Learning skills AI can't replace: creativity, empathy, critical thinking – exactly what we're building here!

1. List current jobs
2. Identify what AI can/can't do in each
3. Imagine how jobs transform, not disappear
4. Design a future job that needs human + AI

## 6.7. The Deepfake Dilemma

### [seq:070] Truth in the Age of AI

###### SCRIPT
We talked about spotting deepfakes, but here's the ethical question: Should they be illegal? What about for movies or art? Where's the line between creativity and deception? If anyone can fake anything, how do we trust anything? It's like living in a world where photography can lie – oh wait, that's our world now!

## 6.8. The Transparency Test

### [seq:080] Right to Know It's AI

###### SCRIPT
Should AI always identify itself? When you chat with customer service, should you know if it's human or AI? What about AI-generated news articles or social media posts? It's like having an invisible friend who everyone else thinks is real. Transparency builds trust, but some companies resist. Where do you stand?
