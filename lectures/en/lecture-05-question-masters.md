## 5.3. The Anatomy of a Great Prompt

### [seq:030] Building Blocks of Success

###### SCRIPT
Let's dissect what makes a prompt amazing! Every great prompt has: Context (what's the situation?), Specific Task (what exactly do you want?), Format (how should it look?), and Constraints (any rules or limits?). It's like giving someone directions â€“ the more specific you are, the better chance they'll get where you want them to go!

###### VISUAL
- Prompt anatomy diagram with labeled parts
- Building blocks stacking to create perfect prompt
- Examples with each component highlighted
- Formula: Context + Task + Format + Constraints = Success

###### NOTES
- CTFC framework easy to remember
- Each element serves specific purpose
- Missing elements = worse results

###### ACTIVITY

## 5.4. Context is King

### [seq:040] Setting the Stage

###### SCRIPT
Imagine asking someone for help without explaining anything â€“ confusing, right? AI needs context too! "You are a helpful tutor for a 9th grade student" gets way better results than no context. Context tells AI what role to play, who it's helping, and what level to aim for. It's like the difference between talking to a friend versus presenting to the principal!

###### VISUAL
- Role-playing cards for AI (tutor, coach, friend, expert)
- Context examples and their effects
- "With context" vs "Without context" results
- AI wearing different hats for different roles

###### NOTES
- Context dramatically changes AI behavior
- Age-appropriate context gets age-appropriate answers
- Role-playing makes AI more helpful

###### DEMONSTRATION
"Context Changes Everything":
1. Same question, different contexts
2. "Explain like I'm 5" vs "Explain like I'm a PhD"
3. "You are a pirate" vs "You are a teacher"
4. See how responses transform

## 5.5. Specificity Superpowers

### [seq:050] The Devil's in the Details

###### SCRIPT
"Write a story" versus "Write a 500-word mystery story set in Tokyo featuring a teenage detective who solves crimes using social media, include a plot twist, and use simple vocabulary" â€“ see the difference? Specificity is your superpower! The more details you include, the more AI can deliver exactly what you need. Vague questions get vague answers!

###### VISUAL
- Zoom in effect: Broad â†’ Specific
- Checklist of details to include
- Side-by-side story comparisons
- Specificity slider showing result quality

###### NOTES

## 5.6. Format and Structure Magic

### [seq:060] Shaping Your Output

###### SCRIPT
Want a list? Ask for a list! Need a table? Say so! AI can format information in dozens of ways, but only if you ask. "Explain in bullet points," "Create a dialogue," "Write as a news article" â€“ these format instructions are like choosing the perfect container for your information. Don't let AI guess what you want!

###### VISUAL
- Format options carousel (lists, tables, dialogues, etc.)
- Same info in different formats
- Format command examples
- "Choose your format" game interface

###### NOTES
- Format affects understanding and usability
- Match format to your actual need
- AI knows many formats - experiment!

###### DEMONSTRATION
"Format Transformation":
1. Get basic information from AI
2. Reformat as: List, table, story, dialogue
3. Discuss which format works best when
4. Create format reference sheet

## 5.7. The Art of Constraints

### [seq:070] Rules That Help

###### SCRIPT
Constraints aren't limitations â€“ they're focusing tools! "Use only simple words," "Keep it under 200 words," "Include 3 examples," "Avoid technical terms" â€“ these rules help AI give you exactly what you need. It's like bowling with bumpers â€“ constraints keep AI in the right lane!

###### VISUAL
- Bowling alley with constraint bumpers
- Examples of helpful constraints
- Before/after with constraints applied

## 5.8. Iteration and Refinement

### [seq:080] The Power of "Try Again"

###### SCRIPT
Here's a secret: prompt engineering isn't about getting it perfect the first time â€“ it's about iteration! Start with a basic prompt, see what you get, then improve it. "Make it funnier," "Add more examples," "Simplify the language" â€“ each iteration gets you closer to what you want. It's like sculpting â€“ you shape it bit by bit!

###### VISUAL

## 5.10. Fact-Checking and Verification

### [seq:090] Trust but Verify

###### SCRIPT
Even with perfect prompts, remember our earlier lessons â€“ AI can still make mistakes! Part of being a Question Master is knowing when and how to verify. Ask AI to cite sources, cross-check important facts, and use multiple AIs for comparison. Here's a recent reality check: Some AI benchmarks that make models look super smart might be "contaminated" â€“ meaning the AI has seen those exact problems during training! It's like a student taking a test with questions they've already practiced. Great prompts reduce errors but don't eliminate them. Stay sharp, detectives!
